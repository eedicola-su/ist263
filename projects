    <h1> Makeup Must Haves </h1>  
    <p>I want to make a website about makeup. I will use various photos of the products themselves, models wearing these products, and also videos of makeup application. I am going to make each page about 3 different brands at 3 different price points to show the various types of makeup available to different consumers. I’m gonna get my information off of google images. </p>
