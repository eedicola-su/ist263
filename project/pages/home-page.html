            The Current Cosmetic Climate 
       </h2>
       <aside>
        The cosmetic industry is constantly evolving as new products, brands, and trends change. The climate of the cosmetic industry has become even more heightened with the popularity of social media "beauty gurus." These gurus review, try-on, and essentially sell makeup to their fans and followers. They have become an integral part of how cosmetic companies sell their products. With the rising influence of these gurus comes the need for both high and low end brands to step up their game. A high end brand is a brand viewed as more luxurious and as a result is a higher price. The one I will be examining is Dior. On the other hand, low end makeup brands create makeup that often is viewed as less quality than higher end makeup and as a result is cheaper. Nyx Cosmetics is a low end brand that I will be examining.
